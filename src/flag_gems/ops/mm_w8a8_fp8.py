"""Public ``mm_w8a8_fp8`` entry.

The THead / PPU implementation lives in
``flag_gems.runtime.backend._thead.ops.mm_w8a8_fp8`` and is installed over
this stub by ``SpecOpRegistrar``. Hopper NVIDIA lands its own backend in
https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems/pull/3821; do not put a PPU kernel in
the generic tree.
